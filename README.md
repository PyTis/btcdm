Below are 3 images describing not one, but two major security holes I found in bitcoind.  If the images do not explain the issue well, then I am sorry, let me know and I will try to explain them further to you, or enhance the images.  But don't think they do not exist.  I confirmed this with MANY pros in the bitcoin IRC channel on freenode.

After you see the 3 images that explain the problem (1st 2 show the 2 security holes, the 3rd shows my proposed solution), you can see a 4th image that explains how the solution program will run.
