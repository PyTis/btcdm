Please note, I had to backburner this for a few months.  I will (I must) finish this.  Our startup company depends on it.  To whoever sent me the micro payment donation, thank you.  Any little bit will help.  It is now June 3rd.  I think I will be back working on this around August 1st.  From there it should only take a few more weeks then I'll be done.  
----- Thank you above.

Please donate!  I am making this for our own project, which is SEVERLY underfunded, but will also benefit the community.

I am sharing this, because I care about the community, and want to see it remain secure and free.

Don't judge the code yet, this is a work in progress.  I will cleanup and comment when I get closer to a release.

Below are 3 images describing not one, but two major security holes I found in bitcoind.  If the images do not explain the issue well, then I am sorry, let me know and I will try to explain them further to you, or enhance the images.  But don't think they do not exist.  I confirmed this with MANY pros in the bitcoin IRC channel on freenode.

After you see the 3 images that explain the problem (1st 2 show the 2 security holes, the 3rd shows my proposed solution), you can see a 4th image that explains how the solution program will run.
